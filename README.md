# 🧠🍽️ 101 Food Classification & Calories Identification

This project leverages computer vision and deep learning to classify food items from the **Food101 dataset** and estimate calorie content per gram. It’s designed as an end-to-end pipeline for food image recognition and calorie estimation, making it suitable for health, nutrition, and fitness applications.

## 📦 Features

- 🍕 **Classification** of 101 food categories using image data
- 🔥 **Calorie estimation** based on average calories per gram for each food type
- 📊 Performance evaluation with accuracy and loss metrics
- 🖼️ Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Keras/TensorFlow
- 📁 Organized dataset loading and preprocessing
- 💾 Model saving/loading support for reusability

## 🗃️ Dataset

- **Food-101** dataset containing 101 images .
- Go through dataset on kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dansbecker/food-101

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the notebook: `Food101 Calorie Estimation.ipynb`
4. Optionally test calorie predictions on your own images!

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 📊 Sample Output

- Predicted Class: `Pizza`
- Estimated Calories: `2.5 calories/gram`

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Use pretrained models like ResNet or EfficientNet
- Enhance calorie estimation using weight detection
- Add mobile/web interface for real-time predictions
